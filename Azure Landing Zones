Azure - Landing Zones 
====================
An Azure landing zone is an environment that follows key design principles across eight design areas. These design principles accommodate all application portfolios and enable application migration,
modernization, and innovation at scale. An Azure landing zone uses subscriptions to isolate and scale application resources and platform resources. 
Subscriptions for application resources are called application landing zones, and subscriptions for platform resources are called platform landing zones.


An Azure landing zone consists of platform landing zones and application landing zones. It's worth explaining the function of both in more detail.

Platform landing zone:
======================
A platform landing zone is a subscription that provides shared services (identity, connectivity, management) to applications in application landing zones
Consolidating these shared services often improves operational efficiency. One or more central teams manage the platform landing zones.
In the conceptual architecture, the "Identity subscription," "Management subscription," and "Connectivity subscription" represent three different platform landing zones. The conceptual architecture shows these three platform landing zones in detail. 
It depicts representative resources and policies applied to each platform landing zone.


Application landing zone:
=========================
An application landing zone is a subscription for hosting an application. You pre-provision application landing zones through code and use management groups to assign policy controls to them.

To xpand an already built Azure landing zone created with Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), follow these key steps and best practices:
=======================================================================================================================================

1. Refactor and Modularize Your Terraform Code
Break your Terraform code into reusable modules for core components like networking, identity, security, and monitoring.
This modular approach makes it easier to add new features or services without disrupting existing resources

2. Align with Azure Landing Zone Design Principles
Review the latest Azure landing zone design areas (identity, resource organization, network topology, governance, etc.) and ensure your expansion aligns with these principles for consistency and compliance

3. Iterative Expansion
Use an iterative approach:

Basic considerations: Refine and update foundational elements, such as networking or identity, as your requirements evolve.

Operations expansions: Add or enhance monitoring, logging, automation, and operational tooling.

Governance expansions: Implement or update policies, RBAC, and cost controls.

Security expansions: Integrate new security controls as needed, such as Azure Policy, Sentinel, or additional logging for compliance

4. Add New Landing Zone Archetypes or Subscriptions
If your organization grows or new requirements emerge (e.g., PCI compliance, new business units), you can add new landing zone archetypes or
subscriptions under the appropriate management group. Assign specific policies and RBAC as needed for these new zones

5. Automate and Test All Changes
Use Terraform workspaces or environments to manage different landing zones or environments (dev, test, prod).

Implement automated tests (using tools like Terratest) to validate changes before applying them to production.

Use CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistent, repeatable deployments and rollbacks

6. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
Update documentation to reflect new components, policies, and procedures.

Communicate changes to relevant teams to ensure smooth adoption and maintenance.

7. Monitor and Optimize
Continuously monitor the health, performance, and cost of your expanded landing zones using Azure Monitor and cost management tools.

Refactor and optimize as needed based on telemetry and business feedback
